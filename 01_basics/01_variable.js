let accountEmail="krish@gmail.com" //we can change it

var accountPassword="1234" //we can change it

/* we prefer let over var because of issue in block scope and function scope*/

let accountState; //javascript consider undefined value if you not assigned

console.log(accountId); //use in print

console.table([accountEmail,accountId,accountState,accountCity]); //it use to print multiple statement in single syntax
